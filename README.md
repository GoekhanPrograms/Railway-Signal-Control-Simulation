# Railway Signal Control Simulation

## Description
This project simulates a railway signal control system using C++. It models track sections, signals, trains, and route settings (Bahnstra√üen) to ensure safe train movements. The simulation demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts, state management, and safety checks typical in railway operations.

## Features
- Track sections represented as graph nodes
- Signal states (RED, YELLOW, GREEN) with automatic updates
- Train movement simulation along defined routes
- Safe route locking to avoid collisions
- Command-line interface for interaction
- Unit tests with GoogleTest to verify logic
